summary: |-
 Runs Jasmine tests.

  Perform unit testing with our **Jasmine Test Runner** Step. 
  If your Cordova/Ionic project has Jasmine dependency in its package.json file, the **Jasmine Test Runner** Step will get automatically inserted in your Workflow. 
  If the dependency is missing from your project, you can manually insert the **Jasmine Test Runner** Step from our StepLib.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Provide your project's working directory in the **Working directory** input.
  3. Add custom options in `jasmine [options]` in the **Options to append to the jasmine command** input.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you insert the **Jasmine Test Runner** Step right after **Run npm command** or **Run yarn command package manager** Step.
